        <h2>Thank You for Agreeing to Review</h2>
        <p>
          Thank you for agreeing to review one or both books in the MX series. Your feedback is important to this project, and I appreciate your time and expertise. As someone who understands web design, accessibility, or AI agent systems, your perspective will help ensure these books serve their intended audience effectively.
        </p>

        <h3>Two Books Available</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>MX-Bible</strong> is the comprehensive 13-chapter guide (~78,000 words plus shared appendices) examining how modern web design optimised for human users fails for AI agents, and how fixing this benefits everyone. It covers the theory, patterns, security implications, and future of agent-mediated commerce in depth.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>MX-Handbook</strong> is the practical 11-chapter implementation guide designed for developers and designers who need actionable patterns and code examples. It focuses on hands-on implementation with clear examples and quick reference material.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may review either book or both - your choice. Both books share the same appendices and cross-reference each other for coherent guidance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section data-section-type="acknowledgment-policy">
        <h2>Reviewer Acknowledgment</h2>
        <p>
          All reviewers will be acknowledged in the final published books. Your contribution matters, and I want to recognize your help publicly. You will be listed in the acknowledgments section of both books, regardless of whether your specific feedback suggestions are incorporated.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-box" data-content-type="important-note">
          <h3>Important Note About Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            Whilst I value all feedback, it's possible that some suggestions may not align with a particular book's direction or planned structure. If this occurs, you will still receive full acknowledgment in the final copies, though the specific suggestions might not be incorporated into the manuscript.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not a reflection on the quality of your feedback—it simply means that particular suggestions didn't fit a particular book's intended scope or approach. Your input remains valuable, and your contribution will be recognized.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section data-section-type="feedback-instructions">
        <h2>How to Submit Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Please send your feedback to <a href="mailto:tom.cranstoun@gmail.com">tom.cranstoun@gmail.com</a>. Any format is welcome—structured comments, inline PDF annotations, bullet points, or general impressions.
        </p>
        <h3>What Kind of Feedback Is Helpful</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Technical accuracy:</strong> Errors, outdated information, or incorrect technical descriptions</li>
          <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Sections that are confusing, unclear, or need better explanation</li>
          <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Organization issues, flow problems, or missing context</li>
          <li><strong>Practical applicability:</strong> Examples that don't work, patterns that need refinement</li>
          <li><strong>Audience fit:</strong> Content that doesn't serve the intended readers effectively</li>
          <li><strong>Missing content:</strong> Important topics that should be covered but aren't</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box" data-content-type="review-status">
          <h3>Review Copy Status</h3>
          <p>
            The PDF versions available are now frozen for review, except for any critical bugs you might identify. This ensures all reviewers are working from the same baseline versions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any significant industry developments or news updates will be documented on the <a href="news.html">News page</a> on this website rather than in the PDFs. The manuscripts will be revised and updated with relevant developments before final publication, incorporating both your feedback and any important industry changes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Publication Timeline</h3>
        <p>
          The book is targeting publication in <strong>Q1 2026</strong>. Feedback received before mid-February 2026 will have the best chance of being incorporated into the final manuscript, though later feedback is still welcome and appreciated.
